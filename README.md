#(FCFS, LRU and Quizes)
FCFS (First Come, First Serve) is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm where 
processes are executed in the exact order they arrive in the ready queue, much like a queue at a store. It is non-preemptive, 
meaning once a process starts, it runs until completion.
LRU (Least Recently Used) is a page replacement and caching algorithm that removes the 
item that has not been used for the longest time when new data needs to be loaded.
